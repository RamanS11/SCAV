The Aim of this lab was to play with the different properties given by the video informations we extract by using the
ffmpeg -i command. 

We have different options, from cuting a 10 seconds of the video, to changing the audio codec used. 

The menu I created is not Robust, therefore the input you must put is a integer number between 1-5, following 
the instuctions given by the menu. The of selections you must follow in the first compilation in order to have some 
results, is; 1, 2, 3, 4. Once you do this, you are free to select any option.
